<!-- Intro -->
  <p> Hello there! My name is Keegan Hutchinson, and I am a Web and Mobile
    Application Development student at NBCC. </p>
    <p> I am a recent graduate of Saint John High School in Saint John, NB.
      Originally planning on taking Business Administration at UNB, I had an itch
      to apply myself to something more creative.
   Looking for something to keep me mentally occupied during the COVID-19 lockdown, i decided to pick up an
    old hobby of mine as a means of self occupation- that hobby being computer programming. </p>

    <h2 id="Code">Coding Endeavours</h2>
    <p>My coding journey pioneered within my freshman year of high school. For fun, i decided to learn
      Python, just to see what i could do. during this time frame, i used the skills i acquired to make little games,
      such as:</p>
<ul>
      <li>Recreating the game 'snake'</li>
      <li>Creating a basic 'conversation bot'</li>
      <li>building small concepts for websites</li>
      <li>a simple 'run and gun' game</li>
</ul>
      <p><i><b>Just to name a few things...</b></i></p>

<u><h2 id="interest">Why I'm Interested in a Career in Software Development</h2></u>
<p>As I previously mentioned, the COVID-19 lockdown gave me lots of time to do some
serious self reflection, and think about what i really wanted in life. with the abundance of freetime I had,
I decided to direct my energy into something more positive to keep me occupied. To name a few of these acquired 'new hobbies' I began to explore
teaching myself various skills such as: </p>

    <dt><b><u>Building E-Commerce Websites: </u></b></dt>
    <dd>When I was younger, I had a decently successful youtube channel, in which I earned quite a lot of money
      making simple youtube videos. Ultimately, this is what sparked my interest in using the interenet as a tool
      that can be utilized to make a passive income. Over the lockdown period, I created two e-commerce shops, with varying
      degrees of success, such as:<br>
<br>

        <li>A small budget electronics shop, that mainly focused on both inexpensive cellphone accessories,
      and a small selection of cheap wireless headphones</li>
        <li>A website centered around home fitness during the pandemic, that primarily sold cheap fitness equiptment.</li>
        <li>A website where I sold refurbished electronics. I would buy them in bulk, and fix them up and sell them off for profit.
      this endeavour proved to be my most successful one.</li>
      </dd>

<br>
<br>
    <dt><b><u>Graphic Design</u></b></dt>
    <dd>Having some previous graphic design skills acquired from some small projects with some school clubs, I decided
      to advertise my skills on fiverr, and utilize my skills to my advantage. This gig proved to be decently successful, and gave
    me quite a bit of exxperience under my belt in that area.</dd>

<br>
<br>
    <dt><b><u>Writing</u></b></dt>
    <dd>Despite most of my previous endavours having a primary focus on financial gains and building a portfolio of some sorts, I decided to
      take up writing, as purely a leisurely hobby I could use to relax and express myself creatively. So far, I have began writing two books- in which I hope to complete
    ideally by the end of the year.</dd>

    <br>
<p>With learning these new skills came the realization that i wanted to do something creative with my life.
weighing what possible options I had for creative yet stable career choices, I decided to take a closer look at software development. meeting both
of the previous criteria, I concluded that learning more about what the profession had in store for me was a step in the right direction, for both developing myself, as well
as my skillset.  </p>

<p id="thought">To put my thought process into a list, here is why my interest in software development as a possible career choice was piqued : </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<ol>

  <li>Software development/I.T related careers are notorious for their high rates of job satisfaction. being satisfied with my future field of work is something that is of upmost importance to me. </li>
  <li>Software development jobs are in great abundance, and are predicted to see above average job growth within the future- making it a stable career choice.</li>
  <li>Salaries within the profession are exceptionally high. though I myself am moreso driven by potential personal satisfaction as opposed to salary exclusively, there is no denying that it presents itself as an amazing perk. </li>
  <li>The general field is also known to be extremely creative in many ways, which is important to someone seeking a stable yet creative career, such as myself.</li>
  <li>The skills associated with being an effective I.T professional (i.e- computer programming) can be easily integrated into many aspects of ones career, and these said skills are exceptionally in demand.</li>
  <li>There is an abundance of oppurtunity to become a freelancer, work from home, and even start your own business if you do so desire. As somebody who wants to travel, this presents itself as an abolute plus.</li>

</ol>
<br>


<p>With all of that being said, so far I believe that I am on the right path, and I am satisfied with my decision so far!</p>
  <p><i><b>Thanks for the view :)</b></i></p>
