Who Am I?

I'm the captain of the starship Enterprise. I have a lot of hair on my head (unlike some other Star Fleet captains I could name). I'm a swash-buckler and a cowboy diplomat. I'm a fighter AND a lover. Hire ME for your next mission.

My Accomplishments

My Fights
Lots of Klingons
The Greek God Apollo
Some blood sucking monster that could change shapes
Finnegan (an academy bully with a nasty left cross)

My Loves
Edith Keeler - she had to die to keep Hitler from taking over the world (it's a long story)
Some android who was created by Brahms (that's another long story)
An Indigenous girl whose planet was about to be destroyed by a comet 
Some alien with blue skin. 
Ruth (That's all. Just Ruth.)

What my friends say about me

Spock:"A most illogical human, who nonetheless plays a mean game of 3D chess."
McCoy:"You're a captain, not a miracle worker Jim."
